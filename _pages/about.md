**<font color='red'> Now I am looking for a PhD position (Fall 2022) related to Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, Human-Computer Interaction or Robotics. Please feel free to contact me (qmren97@163.com)! </font>**

I'm a master student at [College of Automation](https://automation.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn). I am advised by [Prof. Yangang Wang](https://yangangwang.com) and Prof. Haikun Wei. My research interests are **Computer Graphics and Computer Vision**. Besides, I'm also interested in **Disentangled Representation Learning** and **Conditional Generation**. My blogs can be found in [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/AlbertRen) (8.5k followers). I have created **50+** graphics/vision-related notes or answers with **620k readings, 11k favorites and likes**.
    
I was selected as a member of [The International AI Training  Program For Chinese Universities, 2018](http://pkunews.pku.edu.cn/xwzh/2018-04/04/content_301782.htm) (300 out of 7000 people). I used to be a director of Machine Learning Group and Undergraduate Group in Big Data Lab, College of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing Agricultural University.    

I always pay attention to **Computer Graphics & Human-Centered AI** and want to **research for a better world**. If I have the chance, I will pursue a Ph.D. degree.
