I will join Alibaba as a Computer Graphics Algorithm Engineer. I received my master degree in 2022 from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Yangang Wang](https://yangangwang.com). My research interests are **<font color='red'>Computer Graphics</font>** and Computer Vision. 

My blogs can be found in [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/AlbertRen) (10k+ followers). I have created **50+** graphics/vision-related notes or answers with **1,200k readings, 20k favorites and likes**.

I always pay attention to **Computer Graphics** and believe **<font color='red'>"Nature is a great artist and try to reproduce some of its art work with computers"</font>**. **-D: Computer Graphics is Awesome!**
